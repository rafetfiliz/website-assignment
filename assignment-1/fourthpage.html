		<p>I was born in December 2001 in BalÄ±kesir. Because of my father's job I lived in different cities like Tekirdag, Mardin, Ankara, Sakarya.In 2016 I won "Arifiye Fen Lisesi" in Sakarya. I had a great time in this school for 4 years, I made many friends and I have a lot of good memory in this school.
		Finally I graduated in 2020 and won Istanbul Technical University. Also I like reading book, listening to music, riding bicycle, watching movies and series, playing computer games, watching and playing football. </p>
